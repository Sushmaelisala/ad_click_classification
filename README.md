# üì¢ Ad Click Classification

This project focuses on predicting whether a user will click on an advertisement using classification algorithms. The aim is to help marketers and advertisers target the right audience more effectively using user behavior data.

## üßæ Dataset

The dataset likely contains the following features (based on common ad click data):
- `Daily Time Spent on Site`
- `Age`
- `Area Income`
- `Daily Internet Usage`
- `Ad Topic Line`, `City`, `Country`, `Timestamp` (categorical/time)
- `Clicked on Ad` (Target Variable)

> If exact column names differ, refer to the notebook for specifics.

## üéØ Objective

To build a machine learning model that can classify whether a user will **click** on an advertisement or not based on their profile and activity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## üìä Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load data
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Convert timestamp if necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions
   - Correlation matrix
   - Class balance check

3. **Model Building**
   - Train/test split
   - Algorithms used:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine
     - XGBoost (optional)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve


üìå Future Enhancements:

- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

- Cross-validation for better generalization

- Feature importance visualization

- Deploying model as an API/web app

‚úÖ Output:

- Prediction of whether a user will click on an ad

- Classification performance metrics

- Best model selection based on accuracy or ROC-AUC
